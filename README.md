This project is made using electron js, however due to file size I can't include the node and electron json files.<br>
If you want to run this program yourself, install node.js, npm, and electron.js on your machine and run npm init.<br>
In the package.json file, add:<br>
"start": "electron .",<br>
(in "scripts")<br>
and make sure "main": "main.js",<br>
This app is still in development, I will package it when I get more features implemented.<br>
<br>
Feel free to share your oppinion, share advice, and suggest new features!<br>
