This project is made using electron js, however due to file size I can't include the node and electron json files.<br>
If you want to run this program yourself, install node.js and npm on your machine<br>
inside the timer directory run:
npm install --save-dev electron<br>
npm init<br>
In the package.json file:<br>
-change the description to ""
-add "start": "electron ." (in "scripts")<br>
and make sure "main": "main.js",<br>
This app is still in development, I will package it when I get more features implemented.<br>
<br>
Feel free to share your oppinion, share advice, and suggest new features!<br>
